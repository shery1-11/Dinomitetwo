        <p>Researchers have discovered a 149-million-year-old bird fossil in southeastern China, featuring a short tail structure that could rewrite the evolutionary history of birds. As detailed in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the fossil could represent the oldest bird known to scientists and sheds light on the surprising diversification of birds during the Jurassic Period (145 million to 201.3 million years ago).<br><br>
            Paleontologists hypothesize that birds evolved from dinosaurs about 160 million years ago. There is, however, scarce fossil evidence of this early transformation. In fact, the feathered Archaeopteryx—seen as an intermediate link between dinosaurs and modern avians—was the single widely accepted bird to have lived around that time. That is, until now.“This is a groundbreaking discovery. It overturns the previous situation that Archaeopteryx was the only bird found in the Jurassic Period,” Zhonghe Zhou, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and co-author of the study, tells the Chinese news agency Xinhua.
            <br>
            <br>
            The fossil was uncovered in China’s Fujian province in November 2023. While much of the skeleton was intact—including the pelvis, trunk, forelimbs and part of the hindlimbs—the skull was not included. The team also discovered another fossilized bird wishbone from the same site, but it likely dates to the Cretaceous Period (66 million to 145 million years ago).
            <br>
            <br>
            Researchers named the newly discovered Jurassic bird Baminornis zhenghensis. It was a contemporary of Archaeopteryx, roughly quail-sized and featured several characteristics of modern birds, including shoulder and pelvic girdles as well as—most excitingly for paleontologists—a short tail. The evolution of short tails was crucial to the improvement of bird flight, Min Wang, a paleontologist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who co-led the study, tells Xinhua. It helps shift the bird’s center of mass forward, making the animal more aerodynamic.
            <br>

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Previously, the oldest record of short-tailed birds is from the Early Cretaceous,” Wang further explains in a statement. Baminornis is now the “oldest short-tailed bird yet discovered, pushing back the appearance of this derived bird feature by nearly 20 million years.”
            The short tail of Baminornis is in sharp contrast to Archaeopteryx’s long, reptile-like tail. In fact, that tail has caused some researchers to call into question Archaeopteryx’s classification as a bird, especially in comparison to the recently discovered fossil. And it doesn’t help that Archaeopteryx could only engage in short bursts of active flight, like pheasants today.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Baminornis zhenghensis looks more like modern birds than Archaeopteryx,” Wang says to Reuters’ Will Dunham. “In light of all this, I would say Baminornis is probably the oldest unambiguous record of birds,” he adds to New Scientist’s James Woodford.
            <br>
            <br>
            That’s not to say that Baminornis was all modern bird. Its hands, for example, were distinctively dinosaur-like, which demonstrates that different body parts evolved independently to make birds what they look like today.
            <br>
            <br>
            Either way, the existence of two very different early birds (or bird-like creatures) that were located so far apart at roughly the same time in history suggests that millions of additional years of bird evolution likely occurred before either of these creatures lived. Wang thus speculates that birds first emerged between 164 million and 172 million years ago, per Reuters.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Baminornis is a landmark discovery and ranks among the most important bird fossils unearthed since the discovery of Archaeopteryx in the early 1860s,” Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist from the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study but wrote a commentary accompanying it, tells Xinhua.

        <h4>Fossil Hunter Discovers 66-Million-Year-Old Vomit in Denmark, Offering a Clue to the Cretaceous Food Chain
        </h4>
        <h7 class="subhead">A marine animal snacked on some sea lilies that did not agree with its stomach—and we now know what happened next

        <br>
        <p class=>Sixty-six million years ago, a marine creature, minding its own business at the bottom of a Cretaceous sea, munched on some sea lilies—then didn’t feel too great.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, a fossil hunter in Denmark named Peter Bennicke has found the remains of this Cretaceous snack: fossilized vomit. The discovery was announced Monday in a statement from the natural history museum in the Danish town of Faxe, called Geomuseum Faxe.The fossil is “truly an extraordinary find,” as Jesper Milàn, a paleontologist and curator at Geomuseum Faxe, says in the statement, per CNN’s Jack Guy.
        <br>
        <br>
        It all started when Bennicke found some strange fragments on the Danish island of Zealand at Stevns Klint, a fossil-rich, coastal cliff that’s also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He brought the fragments to the Geomuseum Faxe, where experts identified them as pieces of sea lily. These aquatic, plant-like animals related to sea stars and sea urchins are formally called crinoids.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the fossil, the hard-to-digest bits of sea lily were encompassed in chalk. Essentially, it was prehistoric puke, scientifically called regurgitalite.
        <br>
        <br>
        Technically, the sea lily does not appear to have reached the vomiter’s stomach, since “the edges of the fossils are very sharp and clear,” as Paul Olsen, a paleontologist at Columbia University who was not involved with the find, tells NPR’s James Doubek. For that reason, he calls it a “gastric ejection” rather than true vomit. But nevertheless, he adds, it’s an “especially nice example” of a regurgitalite fossil.
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides giving millions of people around the world the chance to giggle about vomit like children, the finding “tells us something about who was eating who 66 million years ago,” Milàn tells the BBC. It helps scientists better understand the organization of the Cretaceous period food chain.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the Late Cretaceous, dinosaurs—including Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor—roamed the land, shortly before the notorious Chicxulub impactor nearly wiped them out. Milàn, however, suspects the animal that ate the sea lilies all that time ago to be a bottom-dwelling shark with crushing teeth instead of sharp ones, as Victor Mather reports for the New York Times.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lilies, however, “aren’t that great to eat, because they are almost only skeleton,” he explains to the New York Times. “So, they took what they could and threw up the rest.”
        <br>
        <br>
        Sharks survived the Chicxulub impactor, and today, the closest living relative of Milàn’s hypothesized shark would be Australia’s Port Jackson shark.
        <br>
        <br>
        The fossilized vomit has been designated “Danekræ,” a unique Danish term for objects discovered in Denmark of significant natural historical value. As of today, more than 1,000 discoveries have been identified as Danekræ, and finders are required by law to hand them over to a natural history museum in the country.While this may now be the “world’s most famous piece of puke,” as Milàn tells the BBC, it’s actually not the oldest. That award goes to 160-million-year-old ichthyosaur vomit discovered in England in 2002, according to Guinness World Records.

        <p>Visitors to the American Museum of Natural History in New York can now feast their eyes on a rare new display: the fossil of a 150-million-year-old, fully grown Stegosaurus named Apex. The exhibit opened Sunday, December 8, and will remain on view for four years.
            <br>
            <br>
            As an herbivore, Apex was certainly no apex predator during its heyday, but the fossilized specimen occupies another kingly position to be deserving of its name: It’s the world’s most expensive dinosaur skeleton sold to date, garnering a record-breaking price of $44.6 million during a Sotheby’s auction in July.
            <br>
            <br>
            The last holder of that title was the fossil assemblage of a Tyrannosaurus rex named Stan. After Stan raked in $31.8 million in an auction in 2020, the sale generated much buzz among paleontologists over the identity of its anonymous buyer. Later, it was revealed that Stan would be homed at a forthcoming natural history museum in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The museum is slated to open its doors and reveal Stan to the world late next year.
            <br>
            <br>
            But in the meantime, the public can see Apex in the flesh—or bones. The identity of Apex’s owner is much less mysterious: The winning bidder was Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund manager and founder of the company Citadel. He has temporarily loaned his extravagant acquisition to the New York museum.
            “Apex offers a unique window into our planet’s distant past,” Griffin says in a statement. “The joy and awe every child feels coloring a Stegosaurus with their crayons will now be brought to life for the millions of people who have the opportunity to see this epic dinosaur in person.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Earlier last week, Apex’s bones arrived at the museum grounds and were quietly put together by the staff, according to Zachary Small and Julia Jacobs of the New York Times. Journalists, photographers, museum staff and elementary school children got an advance look at the assembled dinosaur in all its glory on Thursday morning as the mounted fossil was unveiled with a flourish from behind a beige curtain.
            <br>
            <br>
            Besides being available for public viewing, the fossil will be accessible for scientists to study how the Stegosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic period.
            <br>

            </p>

            Apex is unique for its near completeness, which explains how it earned such an extreme sticker price. While most Stegosaurus fossils are far from whole, Apex, by contrast, contains 254 bones out of a total of approximately 320—a whopping 80 percent of the full set. At 11.5 feet tall and 27 feet long, it’s also the biggest specimen so far, about 30 percent larger than others of its ilk. 
            <br>
            <br>
            That Apex grew to an advanced age provides a valuable opportunity for paleontology, because its remains can reveal insights on metabolism and growth rate throughout the creature’s lifetime. Museum researchers are planning to extract a sample from inside the dinosaur’s thigh bone for further study. “As the bone grows, it preserves a record of growth similar to tree rings,” says Roger Benson, museum curator of dinosaur paleontology, to Gothamist’s Rosemary Misdary. Apex “holds the key to understanding things like the structure of the skeleton of a Stegosaurus and how that changed through the growth of the animal.” As part of Apex’s loan agreement, museum scientists will perform high-resolution 3D scans of Apex’s skeleton and make the data available to the wider scientific community. They also plan to make a cast of the fossil that they can continue to display after the loan is over.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are no visible signs that Apex was attacked while it was alive, leading scientists to believe that it died of natural causes. However, its skeleton bears a curious scar for those who look closely. As Isaac Shultz of Gizmodo reports, the shoulder blade contains a puncture wound that’s embedded with a bone fragment from Apex’s own tail. Perhaps the wound was self-inflicted when the dinosaur curled around itself, Benson tells the publication.While T. rex might be one of the most beloved dinosaurs thanks to movies like Jurassic Park and The Land Before Time, the Stegosaurus is also iconic in its own right. Its most recognizable feature is the row of tall diamond-shaped plates along its spine. Since the first discovery of Stegosaurus in the 19th century, scientists have been debating what functions the back plates serve, and it remains an enigma to this day. Suggestions range from temperature regulation to come-hither ornamentation for attracting mates, to tools of self-defense.
            <br>
            <br>
            The dinosaur’s primary weapon, however, is its barbed tail; researchers know this from observing that one fossil of a contemporaneous dinosaur predator bears a painful-looking hole matching the size of a Stegosaurus tail spike. Plus, the tails in fossils often come damaged, as if the animals had used them in battle.
            <br>
            <br>
            Apex was discovered by commercial paleontologist Jason Cooper in 2022 just outside the fittingly named town of Dinosaur, Colorado, near the Utah border.
            <br>
            <br>
            The rise of selling fossils to private collectors has stirred up much concern among the scientific community. As fossils fetch ever growing sums of cash from bidders, paleontologists are concerned that they’ll be priced out of the ability to gain access to these specimens in the name of research. Moreover, not all fossils in private holdings will be made publicly available to researchers. As with any scientific investigation, data reproducibility is key, so if specimens stay behind closed doors for the personal enjoyment of a private owner, researchers the world over might not be able to examine the fossils and reproduce findings from their peers, according to a 2014 analysis in Palaeontologica Electronica. Per the New York Times, some scientists have fretted that Apex won’t be available for research after its four-year tenure at the museum.“This is a new gray area for us,” Stuart Sumida, the president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, tells the New York Times. The society is deliberating the ethics of how the paleontological community should handle fossils on loan and will release their recommendations around next spring.
            <br>
            <br>
            For now, many other researchers see Griffin’s loan as an immeasurable gift, given how singular of a fossil Apex is. “It’s one of the dinosaurs that every kid knows how to draw,” Sean M. Decatur, the museum’s president, told the New York Times before Apex’s grand reveal. “[It] is really a pretty special specimen to understand.”
